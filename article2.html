			<p>Raise your hand if you are tired!  Turns out, you’re not alone. More and more people today are suffering from the effects of burnout. Between working, studying, socializing, exercising and just trying to balance it all as best we can—it’s no wonder we’re feeling like we could do with a bit more sleep. But before you go reaching for your next caffeine hit there are some simple things you can do. Incorporating the following foods into your diet which can help you feel more energized, focused and productive.</p>

			<div class="pg1">
				<h2>Up the H20</h2>
				<p>Drink a full 16 ounces of water. Hate water, add lemon or make a fruit infusion with various berries, mint, or citrus. I also love adding Sakara Detox Water to my water. Wait 15 minutes and I promise you will perk right up!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg2">
				<h2>Sprouted Grains</h2>
				<p>Grains are full of an array of vitamins and minerals, and sprouted grains (those which have been left to germinate) are filled with nutritious goodness, and energy boosters! Vitamins such as B complex and C are readily available in sprouted grains, resulting in easily absorbed nutrients and energy! So switch over your normal carbs for sprouted!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg3">
				<h2>Avocado</h2>
				<p>A great source of dietary fats, that keep us full for longer! As well as good fats, avocados are full of nutrients, including protein which also helps with sustained energy. Adding avocado into your breakfast, lunch or dinner (or all three) can help energy slumps!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg4">
				<h2>Bananas</h2>
				<p>A great source of potassium as well as carbohydrates which fuels us for energy for a workout! Filled with vitamins, minerals and fiber you cannot go past a banana for those times where you need an extra pick me up!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg5">
				<h2>Fatty Fish</h2>
				<p>Salmon and other fatty fish are rich in Omega 3’s. Eating fatty fish helps with inflammation, and inflammation can cause fatigue. SO eating fish a few times a week can help with lowering cardiovascular disease, help with healthy skin, healthy brain and a a great energy source!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg6">
				<h2>Nuts and seeds</h2>
				<p>Trial mix of nuts and seeds are filled with good fats and proteins and are such a good choice for an energy-dense snack! Nuts and seeds have many health benefits including great for skin health, heart health and giving you a burst of energy where needed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg7">
				<h2>Dark Chocolate</h2>
				<p>Say no more! Dark chocolate contains theobromine. Theobromine gives you a good boost of energy without the crash that caffeine-filled counterparts can. It’s gentle and gives you an energy that is sustained.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg8">
				<h2>Eggs</h2>
				<p>Poached, fried, sunny side up. However you like your eggs, these little guys are packed full of goodness! Think protein and B vitamins to give you a steady source of energy all day!</p>
