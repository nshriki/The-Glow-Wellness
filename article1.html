			<p>With it being my birthday month, I thought we could talk about youthfulness – particularly glowing youthful skin. It’s hard to believe I have hit my late 40s, eek, where did the time go! But along the way I have learned a thing or two! So today I am spilling ALL OF MY SECRETS for absolutely glowing skin, at any age.</p>

				<h2>Your skin reflects your inner health</h2>
				<p>It is an external reflection of what is happening internally. So despite beauty being a serious industry/big business, it is really the icing on the cake.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg2">
				<h2>Internal Skincare</h2>
				<p>IThe foundation of glowing, radiant healthy skin (especially as we age), is internal skincare. By internal I mean what you eat, how you take care of your body, and your emotional, mental, and spiritual health. These ALL affect how your skin looks / feels.</p>
				<p>It took me years to get where I am with my skin – my skin is taught, youthful, clear, and glowing. I didn’t think I would have the best skin of my life at 47! BUT my skin reflects how I have majorly cleaned up my diet — and my life. My skincare & makeup are now what they should be, an afterthought. I feel confident in my skin and I go au natural most days.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg3">
				<h2>All my skin secrets</h2>
				<p>So for the 1st ever I am spilling ALL OF MY SECRETS for absolutely glowing skin, at any age:</p>
				<p>1. It starts with what I put into my body to support glowing skin, and the foods to avoid. Lots of greens, (I truly eat the rainbow) good fats for suppleness, extra hydration, and avoiding inflammatories (gluten, dairy and bad oils).</p>
				<p>2. I drink my matcha daily to support my skin. I use Pique’s Sun Goddess Matcha. It has EGCG to firm and brighten skin, and chlorophyll to clarify.</p>
				<p>Then there are my go-to “skin ingestibles” as I like to call them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg4">
				<h2>The Internal Skincare Trio</h2>
				<p>There are three power supplements I use:</p>
				<p>Collagen, vitamin C & a new supplement called B•Tox that I am absolutely loving. </p>
				<p><span class="bolded">1. Collagen</span> I use Agent Nateur Holi Mane -THE supplement for flourishing hair, radiant skin & anti-aging. It stimulates collagen production, hydration, and reduces inflammation (I love this brand so much I requested a discount code, it is glowwellness)</p>
				<p><span class="bolded">2. Vitamin C</span> Pique Tea Daily Radiance with C & antioxidants builds collagen, combats sun damage & helps smoothen and brighten skin from the inside out</p>
				<p><span class="bolded">3. B•T Fountain</span> (also from Pique) is revolutionary for hydration. It is proven to visibly improve skin elasticity & reduce fine lines. It also contains natural ceramides & hyaluronic acid to support a youthful, dewy glow. </p>
				<p>Next are probiotics and prebiotics. Growing research suggests that skin care products with prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics help to rebalance your healthy microbes. A balanced microbiome improves skin elasticity, clarity, and even wrinkles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg5">
				<h2>A few more tips…</h2>
				<p>A skincare routine is also essential. I talk about my skin a lot here my site – just search “skin” or “anti-aging”. I also address treatments in many of my posts. A great one to refer to is “My favorite (and not so favorite) in-office treatments to reverse the clock”.</p>
				<p>Last, but not least, your emotional and spiritual well-being greatly impact your skin and natural glow. The most beautiful people are the ones who are comfortable with themselves. You can read my latest post to learn more about that.</p>
				<p>To anyone who is reading this in their 20s and 30s, know that there is hope for better skin as you age. I would never have believed this in my younger years…but it for sure has to do with feeling confident, comfortable, and self-assured with aging. And that feels pretty damn good!</p>

				<h2>More on the revolutionary B-T Fountain</h2>
				<!-- <img src="bfount.png" alt="b-fountain"> -->
				<p>This is a revolutionary beauty electrolyte, run and grab it because it is selling out.</p>
				<p>Here’s why you need B-T Fountain in your routine. . .</p>
				<p>Hyaluronic Acid = your body’s natural moisturizer </p>
				<p>A stronger skin barrier only helps if you’re properly hydrated from the inside. Your body makes hyaluronic acid to lubricate your skin and connective tissue (your joints!) Hyaluronic acid physically attracts water and binds it to your collagen, replenishing moisture levels. Think of it like a sponge that soaks up water. B-T Fountain is a complete breakthrough in skin hydration. It is also important to note there are no preservatives, additives or sugar.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg7">
				<p>B-T Fountain- isn’t she beautiful?</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg8">
				<h2>An overview of the ingredients:</h2>
				<p><span class="bolded">Ceramides</span> Clinically proven to restore your skin barrier, ceramides visibly improve fine lines and increase skin elasticity.</p>
				<p><span class="bolded">Hyaluronic acid</span> Replenishing essential compounds, hyaluronic acid attracts and holds water deep within your skin cells enhancing your skin’s moisture content and giving a youthful glow.</p>
				<p><span class="bolded">Electrolyte minerals</span> Promoting deep cellular hydration, these busy minerals energize and boost your cells using bioavailable mineral chelates.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="pg9">
				<h2>My Experience</h2>
				<p>I’ve been drinking B-T Fountain for the past two years and I just can’t stop at this point. My skin feels so much brighter and better hydrated, my fine lines have reduced –and most importantly, I have an inner glow. Combine B-T Fountain with your usual skincare routine and enjoy the multiplier effect as you improve your skin’s natural moisture production from within. Even better, it’s non-GMO, gluten-free, and it is a delicious Yuzu Berry flavor.</p>

			<div class="pg10">
				<h2>When you have optimal levels, your deep skin layers are hydrated and happy. Together with a strong barrier, that equals supple, glowing skin.</h2>
